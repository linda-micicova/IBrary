The solid line and the dotted line show the displacement at t = 0 and \nt = 0.882 ms, respectively. The period of the wave is greater than 0.882 ms. A \ndisplacement to the right of the equilibrium position is positive. \n\nThe equilibrium position of a particle in the medium is at x = 0.80 m.

However,\nthis is a longitudinal wave, and so the appropriate option is \u2018left\u2019, as this coincides\nwith the parallel particle oscillations and wave propagation.
